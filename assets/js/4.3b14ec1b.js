The overview of DeepBurning is shown in Figure 1. It only requires the dataset of the target application and high-level design constraints such as total resource budget to produce a unified optimized acceleration solution targeting at a typical heterogeneous CPU+FPGA architecture that can be immediately deployed, while the application developers can focus on the application development without dealing with the complex neural network model designing nor the low-level accelerator parameter tuning. Particularly, we propose an efficient co-designed autoML search framework named YOSO [2] that seeks to optimize the neural network architecture and the NPU parameters at the same time.
