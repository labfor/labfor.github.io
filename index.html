      Automatic generation of FPGA-based learning accelerators

It aims to provide a complete FPGA-based acceleration solution for a specific learning task. Figure xxx illustrates the overview of the design tool. It starts from the data of the learning tasks and automatically search the optimized neural network model and accelerator configuration using the proposed YOSO AutoML technique while the user only needs to provide the high-level design goals such as fps metric and design constraints like FPGA resoruces.

For example, Pseudo-Aristotle is the name given to persons who falsely wrote under the name of Aristotle to give their own ideas greater credibility. The false ascription of authorship is called pseudepigraphy, and the works themselves are called pseudepigrapha. The 'pseudo-' prefix is not used for pseudonyms, false names used to hide one's true identity.
In linguistics, the prefix 'pseudo-' is also applied to certain categories of loanwords in which words are used in a way that does not coincide with the way the word is used in the original language. For example, the English word handy has been adopted in colloquial German as the term for a mobile/cell phone. This is known as a pseudo-anglicism.
In historiography, the prefix 'pseudo' is also applied to imposters or false claimants to a throne, for example Pseudo-Nero.
In pharmacology, the 'pseudo' prefix is also used to identify an alternate form of a pharmacological compound. For example, pseudoephedrine.
In the study of art, the 'pseudo' prefix is applied to an imitation of the artistic style of a different cultural background (in contradistinction to neo-, the imitation of a style of an earlier epoch). For example, Pseudo-Kufic, Pseudo-Cyrillic, Pseudo-Chalcidian, pseudo-naïve.
In geology and geography, the 'pseudo' prefix is also used for topographical formations that superficially appear to have been formed by one process, but were formed by another. For example, pseudo-atoll.
In mathematics, the 'pseudo' prefix is also applied to items that are similar to (or mathematically behave like) something else, but not exactly that. For example, pseudo-arcs, pseudorandomness, pseudoprime.
In Networking, the 'pseudo' prefix is used to behaves like something that is tangible e.g. a pseudo wire.
Pseudepigrapha in the Christian Bible, are falsely attributed works of unknown authors, falsified, interpolated, and forged into mostly Greek scripture.
In anthropology, the 'pseudo' prefix is applied to cultural representation, most commonly related to indigenous cultures. A pseudo-culture is a form of cultural expression that was designed for monetary gain, and helps to further erode cultural identity of natives. It strays from authentic traditions and provides a false representation of a culture</p> <h3 id="performance-evaluation"><a href="#performance-evaluation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Performance evaluation</h3> <p>In literary studies, the prefix 'pseudo-' is used to indicate false attribution of authorship.
